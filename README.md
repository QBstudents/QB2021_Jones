#Quantitative Biodiversity course, Spring 2021, Indiana University
##Joshua Jones, jaj35@iu.edu

Hello, my name is Josh and I'm a second year Ph.D. student in Armin Moczek's lab. My principle interests are in researching how insects utilize their microbiomes to fit into their ecological niches and how that reliance on their microbes shapes and constrains their evolution. Currently, I am working on a project to understand how *Onthophagus taurus* beetles' microbiome changes across their different life stages and what mechanisms they use to maintain important members. Mainly, to 1) confirm that mothers utilize the pedestal to pass microbes to larva, since there is no direct contact between mother and offspring, and 2) if the pupal chamber acts as a storage for the microbiota, since retaining a large number of microbes within the insect during the pupal stage can be dangerous. Interestingly enough, prior to coming to graduate school I had very little experience with either entomology or microbiology but spent my entire undergraduate career working on lizard and spider behavior (notably a failed attempt to get spiders to solve and learn mazes). After graduate school I would like to persue a postdoc and go into academia but I am also open to going into industry if possibly.

Course expectations:
1. Learn how to quantify beta-diversity between samples
1. Learn how to measure significance of beta-diversity
1. Learn how to utilize multivariate statistics to find whatever patterns of similarity or dissimilarity can be found within the data
1. Learn how to properly document and store statistics workflows to create reproducible data.
